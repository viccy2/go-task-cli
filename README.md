# Go Task CLI 

A lightweight, high-performance Command Line Interface (CLI) tool built in Go for managing daily tasks. JSON-based data persistence, and a fully automated CI/CD pipeline.



## Features
- **Task Management:** Create, list, complete, and delete tasks instantly.
- **Smart Search:** Built-in case-insensitive search to find specific tasks.
- **Data Persistence:** Tasks are stored in a local `tasks.json` file—no database setup required.
- **Zero Dependencies:** Built entirely with the Go Standard Library for maximum portability and speed.
- **Automated CI/CD:** Integrated with GitHub Actions to provide pre-compiled binaries for every update.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
- **Language:** Go 1.22+
- **Architecture:** Decoupled logic (internal package) and interface (cmd package).
- **Serialization:** JSON encoding/decoding for local state management.
- **Automation:** GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds and artifact generation.
